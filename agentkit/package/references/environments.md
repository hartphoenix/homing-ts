# environments.md — exact commands per environment

Read this in Phase 5, after the probe. Pick the section matching `probe.json.os` (or
`cloud_harness: true`). Everything here is a command you run, not advice you paraphrase.

Commands marked **[unverified]** were not measured on real hardware during research. Say so if
you rely on one; never assert it worked when you did not watch it work.

---

## 0. Rules that hold in every environment

**Touch-probe every path before you use it.** `~/.claude/skills` and `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
were both non-writable in a real probe on a machine where both obviously "should" have worked.
A path that exists is not a path you may write.

```sh
probe_dir() {  # probe_dir <dir> -> prints WRITABLE or DENIED, leaves nothing behind
  mkdir -p "$1" 2>/dev/null
  if touch "$1/.wprobe" 2>/dev/null; then rm -f "$1/.wprobe"; echo "WRITABLE $1"
  else echo "DENIED   $1"; fi
}
```

**Two kinds of destination, never mixed.** Markdown (`homing-check/SKILL.md`, `JUDGE.md`) goes
to a *skill directory*; scripts, config, state and logs go to the OS application-support / state
directories below. Never put a runnable script or a state file in a skill directory.

**Canonical skill install, then fan out by symlink.**

```sh
install -d -m 0755 "$HOME/.agents/skills"                       # canonical
# ...write homing-check/ here...
ln -sfn "$HOME/.agents/skills/homing-check" "$HOME/.claude/skills/homing-check"
```

Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot and OpenCode read `~/.agents/skills` natively; Claude Code
does **not** and needs the symlink. If the symlink target is not writable, install a second copy
there and record both paths plus a content hash in the manifest. On Windows without Developer
Mode, `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink` fails — copy and hash. Claude Code cloud sessions read
neither: they load account-level skills and the cloned repo's `.claude/skills/` only.

**The key never appears in a job definition.** `launchctl print`, `systemctl show`,
`schtasks /query /v` and `docker inspect` all print their environment dictionaries in cleartext
to any process of that user. The scheduler stores a *path to a script*; the script fetches the
value at run time into an unexported shell variable.

**`<state>/install-manifest.json` records every directory, file, symlink, scheduler identifier
and secret-store item created.** Uninstall reads it; uninstall never guesses.

## 1. macOS

### Paths (all under `~/Library/` — this is not a preference)

```
~/Library/Application Support/Homing/          config + bin      0700
~/Library/Application Support/Homing/state/    state             0700
~/Library/Logs/Homing/                         logs              0700
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.homing.check.plist  scheduler         0644
~/.agents/skills/homing-check/                 generated skill
```

A launchd-spawned process has no Full Disk Access and no bundle identity, so TCC cannot even
show a consent dialog. Reads and writes under `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads` and
`~/Library/Mobile Documents` (iCloud) fail with `Operation not permitted` — **silently, only
when the scheduler runs it**, never when you test by hand from a terminal that has FDA. If the
search genuinely needs a user folder, say plainly that background jobs are blocked from it and
keep your files in `~/Library/` anyway. Never ask anyone to grant a terminal Full Disk Access
for a housing search.

Check the config dir's `realpath`: refuse to install into iCloud Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive,
Syncthing, or a synced `Documents`.

### Scheduler — LaunchAgent only

**Never crontab on macOS.** Writing a crontab from a non-interactive process trips TCC
(`AUTHREQ_ATTRIBUTION`); the setuid `crontab` binary blocks on a consent dialog an unattended
installer can never answer, and the install hangs forever. `launchctl bootstrap` triggers no TCC
prompt at all.

**Never a LaunchDaemon.** Daemons run in the system session and cannot read the login keychain
(`errSecInternalComponent` / item-not-found, with `SessionCreate` either way).

`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.homing.check.plist`, mode 0644, absolute paths only (launchd does
not expand `~`), and **no token anywhere in it**:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

  <key>ExitTimeOut</key><integer>30</integer>
  <key>ProcessType</key><string>Adaptive</string>
  <key>LowPriorityIO</key><true/>
</dict></plist>
```

`StartCalendarInterval` **only**: `StartInterval` silently drops a fire if the machine was
asleep *or the previous run was still going*, and the two keys are not aware of each other.
launchd's default `PATH` is only `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` — set it explicitly.
`RunAtLoad` stays false (Apple: "should be avoided"). Never set `KeepAlive` — it implies
`RunAtLoad` and turns a one-shot into a respawning daemon. `ProcessType Background` throttles
CPU and I/O hard; use `Adaptive`.

```sh
U=$(id -u); P="$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.homing.check.plist"
plutil -lint "$P"                                    # validate BEFORE loading
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$U" "$P"                    # install, no sudo, no TCC prompt
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$U/com.homing.check"     # run once now (required: see below)
launchctl print "gui/$U/com.homing.check" | grep -E 'state|runs|last exit code'
launchctl blame "gui/$U/com.homing.check"            # why it last started
```

Bootstrapping at 4pm a plist whose time was 9am catches up **nothing**; `runs` stays 0. Never
promise a catch-up run at install time — `kickstart` explicitly, and treat `runs = 0` after a
kickstart as a failed install. A job label is single-instance, so a fire arriving mid-run is
dropped and a long overrun silently loses the next day: keep the run short and keep the lock.

Never run `pmset repeat wakeorpoweron` on the user's behalf — it needs root and a machine holds
only one repeating pair, so setting it clobbers whatever is already there. To keep the Mac awake
*during* a run, wrap the work in `caffeinate -s` (no root needed).

### Secret store — `/usr/bin/security`, human-run

Write and read with the **same binary**. A language keyring library (Python `keyring`, Node
`keytar`) stamps the item's partition list with that interpreter's team ID; the next Homebrew
upgrade changes the signature and the job starts an un-dismissable 3am password-prompt storm
that "Always Allow" does not fix, because that edits the ACL, not the partition list.

The installer writes `<config>/connect.sh` (0700, in a 0700 dir) and prints exactly one line
for the user to run: `sh "<config>/connect.sh"`. That is the pairing path, and it is the one to
offer: the user approves a short code in their own browser and the key travels from Homing into
the keychain without anyone typing or seeing it. The wrapper exports the same
`HOMING_TOKEN_STORE` / `HOMING_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE` / `HOMING_TOKEN_FILE` values the runner
exports, then calls `homing.py pair-poll --store`; without that export the key lands in the
platform default, pairing still reports success because its own verifying read is defaulted the
same way, and the first scheduled run fails with exit 78.

`<config>/set-token.sh` is still written, and it is the **fallback**, not the default: use it
only where pairing cannot work — no browser on the machine, or an operator handing over a key
minted elsewhere. It reads stdin with `stty -echo` + `IFS= read -r`, feeds
`security add-generic-password -U -a "$USER" -s homing-api-token -w` the value **twice**
(prompt mode asks twice; every published one-liner that pipes once is wrong), and verifies by
HTTP status code alone against `__HOMING_ORIGIN__/api/v1/me/projects`. Never `-w <value>` (argv),
never `-p`, never `-A`.

Run-time retrieval, with a watchdog because a locked login keychain makes `security` sit on a
GUI prompt forever under launchd:

```sh
TOKEN=$(perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 20 \
  /usr/bin/security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s homing-api-token -w 2>/dev/null) || {
    st=$?; [ "$st" -eq 44 ] && echo "homing: no key stored" >&2 || echo "homing: keychain unavailable ($st)" >&2
    exit 78; }
```

Exit 44 is `errSecItemNotFound`. Never export `TOKEN`; hand it to `curl` through `--config -` on
stdin so it never enters argv. If the *installer's own* keychain attempt returns
`Operation not permitted` or exit 152, that is the agent's sandbox, **not** a Mac without a
keychain — route to the human-run path, which is the correct path regardless.

### Pause / uninstall

```sh
U=$(id -u)
launchctl bootout "gui/$U/com.homing.check"          # PAUSE (keep the plist)
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$U" "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.homing.check.plist"   # RESUME
# UNINSTALL, in this order
launchctl bootout "gui/$U/com.homing.check" 2>/dev/null
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Homing/state/run.lock"
rm -f  "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.homing.check.plist"
security delete-generic-password -a "$USER" -s homing-api-token
rm -rf "$HOME/.agents/skills/homing-check" "$HOME/.claude/skills/homing-check"
```

`launchctl disable` alone does not reliably stop an already-loaded job in the current boot; use
`bootout` and keep the plist so resume is one command.

```

### Scheduler — systemd **user** timer

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/homing-check.service
[Unit]
Description=Homing recurring search
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=%h/.config/homing/bin/run.sh
WorkingDirectory=%h/.config/homing
RuntimeMaxSec=1200
TimeoutStopSec=30
LoadCredentialEncrypted=homing-api-token:%h/.config/homing/token.cred
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
SyslogIdentifier=homing-check
PrivateTmp=true
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ReadWritePaths=%h/.local/state/homing
```

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/homing-check.timer
[Unit]
Description=Homing recurring search timer
[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 09:37:00
Persistent=true
RandomizedDelaySec=600
FixedRandomDelay=true
AccuracySec=1min
Unit=homing-check.service
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```sh
systemd-analyze calendar '*-*-* 09:37:00'        # validate the expression FIRST
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now homing-check.timer
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"                   # REQUIRED headless / logged-out
systemctl --user list-timers homing-check.timer  # NEXT / LEFT / LAST / PASSED
systemctl --user start homing-check.service      # run once now
journalctl --user -u homing-check.service -n 200 --no-pager
```

`Persistent=true` runs a missed occurrence once at next boot/login instead of skipping the day
(`OnCalendar=` only). Overlap prevention is free: a timer whose `Type=oneshot` unit is still
active does not restart it. `RuntimeMaxSec=` kills a hung run and marks the unit failed, which
is what makes `systemctl --user status` a real health signal. `loginctl enable-linger` is the
difference between "runs while the user has a session" and "runs after boot with nobody logged
in".

**cron fallback** — only when `systemctl --user is-system-running` gives nothing (Alpine/OpenRC,
minimal containers, WSL1, Termux):

```cron
37 9 * * * flock -n /run/user/1000/homing.lock -c '$HOME/.config/homing/bin/run.sh' >>$HOME/.local/state/homing/cron.log 2>&1
```

Install with `crontab -l > f; ...; crontab f` — never `crontab -` blind, it destroys existing
entries. State the weaknesses plainly: no catch-up when the machine was off, a minimal
environment (`PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, no D-Bus session, so no keyring), and `%` must be escaped.

### Secret store — systemd credentials

The value never enters the environment, never appears in the unit, is exposed as a read-only
file, and is removed when the service stops.

```sh
# human-run, once
install -d -m 0700 ~/.config/homing
printf 'Paste your Homing key, then press Return: ' >&2; IFS= read -rs T; printf '\n' >&2
printf '%s' "$T" | systemd-creds encrypt --user --uid=self --name=homing-api-token - ~/.config/homing/token.cred
unset T; chmod 600 ~/.config/homing/token.cred
```

`--user` encryption needs systemd 256+ (`systemctl --version`); below that use plain
`LoadCredential=homing-api-token:%h/.config/homing/token` with a 0600 file. The runner reads
`TOKEN=$(cat "$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY/homing-api-token")` — never a hardcoded `/run/credentials`
path, never `EnvironmentFile=` (that puts it in `/proc/<pid>/environ`, inherited by every child).

**Never use `secret-tool`/libsecret for a scheduled job.** It needs a live Secret Service on the
D-Bus *session* bus; under cron or a lingering user unit you get `Cannot autolaunch D-Bus
without X11 $DISPLAY`, and `dbus-run-session --` "fixes" the test while leaving the real job
broken by spawning a fresh, empty bus.

Fallback 0600 file: create directory and file under `umask 077` in a subshell, or
`install -m 600 /dev/stdin`. `mkdir` then `chmod` leaves a real world-readable window.

### Pause / uninstall

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now homing-check.timer     # PAUSE, survives reboot
systemctl --user enable  --now homing-check.timer     # RESUME
# UNINSTALL
systemctl --user disable --now homing-check.timer
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/homing-check.{timer,service}
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user reset-failed homing-check.service
systemctl --user clean --what=state homing-check.timer   # removes the Persistent= stamp
rm -f ~/.config/homing/token.cred
```

Enable-ScheduledTask  -TaskName 'Homing\HomingCheck'      # RESUME
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'Homing\HomingCheck' -Confirm:$false   # UNINSTALL
```

`-RunLevel Limited`, never `Highest`. Never put the key in `-Argument`: the task XML under
`C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\` is readable text and `schtasks /query /v` prints the full command
line.

### The logon-type / DPAPI decision — pick one, out loud

| Shape | Runs signed out? | Secret store that works | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-LogonType Interactive` | no | **DPAPI file** (`ConvertFrom-SecureString`) | task does not run while signed out |
| `-LogonType S4U` | yes | Credential Manager `CredRead` only | **DPAPI is unavailable** — no user master key |
| `-LogonType Password` | yes | DPAPI | stores the Windows password; never do this |

S4U + DPAPI is the number-one "worked on my machine" Windows bug: it fails **only** at scheduled
runtime, never in an interactive test. Default to **`Interactive` + DPAPI** and say the plain
sentence: *"This runs while you're signed in to this PC."* Use `S4U` only when the probe finds a
readable Credential Manager path already installed — `cmdkey` cannot read a secret back at all,
and installing the `CredentialManager` module means a PSGallery trust prompt you should not
create for a non-technical user. **[unverified: S4U + CredRead was not exercised.]**

### Secret store — DPAPI, human-run

```powershell
$dir = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'Homing'; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dir | Out-Null
$file = Join-Path $dir 'token.dpapi'
$sec = Read-Host -AsSecureString 'Paste your Homing key, then press Enter'
$sec | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Set-Content -Path $file -Encoding ascii -NoNewline
icacls $file /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R,W)" | Out-Null
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri '__HOMING_ORIGIN__/api/v1/me/projects' -Authentication Bearer -Token $sec | Out-Null
```

`Read-Host -AsSecureString` keeps it out of PSReadLine history. `ConvertFrom-SecureString`
without `-Key` is DPAPI, keyed to this user on this machine — the file is worthless if copied.
At run time hand the `SecureString` straight to `Invoke-RestMethod -Authentication Bearer
-Token`; never materialise it into a string.

---

## 4. Always-on cloud harness

### Container

Prefer a **supervisor loop** over a cron daemon: most slim images ship no cron, and container
cron inherits an empty environment.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
INTERVAL="${HOMING_INTERVAL_SEC:-86400}"
trap 'exit 0' TERM INT
while :; do
  START=$(date +%s)
  timeout -k 30 1200 /opt/homing/bin/run.sh || echo "run exited $?"
  ELAPSED=$(( $(date +%s) - START )); SLEEP=$(( INTERVAL - ELAPSED ))
  [ "$SLEEP" -lt 60 ] && SLEEP=60
  sleep "$SLEEP"
done
```

Overlap is structurally impossible; the hung-run bound is `timeout -k`; restart policy comes
from the orchestrator (`restart: unless-stopped`). If cron is required, write
`/etc/cron.d/homing` with `37 9 * * *`, send output to `>/proc/1/fd/1 2>/proc/1/fd/2`, and run
`cron -f` under `tini`.

Secret: a **mounted file**, read inside `run.sh`. Compose `secrets:` (mounted at
`/run/secrets/<name>`), never `environment:` — env vars show in `docker inspect`, are inherited
by every child, and bake into image layers if set via `ENV`/`ARG`. Never render a compose file
into your own output unredacted: `docker compose config` interpolates `env_file` values inline.
Verify secret files by shape (`stat`), never by content.

### Claude Code cloud Routine

Only when `/schedule` is present (hidden on Console API keys, Bedrock/Vertex, or when
`DISABLE_TELEMETRY` / `DO_NOT_TRACK` / `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` /
`DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK` is set). Minimum interval one hour.

**Mandatory extra step:** Edit routine → environment → Network access → Custom → add the Homing
host. The Default environment is Trusted and allows only Anthropic's package-registry allowlist;
otherwise every Homing request 403s with `x-deny-reason: host_not_allowed` **while the routine
still shows green**. Green means the session started and exited without an infrastructure error
— nothing more. The success signal is the Homing run record, never the badge.

Secret: a **dedicated** cloud environment's variables, not a shared Team environment (docs: they
are "visible to anyone who uses the environment").

### GitHub Actions

`schedule: - cron: '37 9 * * *'` (UTC), plus `workflow_dispatch: {}` for a Run-now button,
`concurrency: {group: homing-search, cancel-in-progress: false}`, `timeout-minutes: 20`,
`permissions: {contents: read}`, and the secret in `env:` of the single step that needs it.
Keep the repo private and the triggers `schedule` + `workflow_dispatch` only.

Say the two costs out loud before choosing it: fires can be delayed 5–30 minutes or dropped
under load, and **in a public repo a scheduled workflow is auto-disabled after 60 days with no
repository activity** — a silent failure with one email to whoever last enabled it. Secret
masking is exact-substring only: anything that base64s, JSON-wraps or URL-encodes the value
stops being masked.

Whatever remote host is chosen, mint a **separate key for that worker** so revoking it does not
break the local one, record its issue date in `<state>/state.json`, and tell the user in their
own words that someone else's computer now holds a key to their searches — and that turning it
off is one click in Homing.

---

## 5. No durable scheduler

When nothing writable answers — no LaunchAgent dir, no systemd, no Task Scheduler, no cloud
harness — **do not fake it**. Install the on-demand runner: `homing-check` in the skill
directory, `run.sh` in the config directory, no scheduler artifact, and one plain sentence:
*"I couldn't find a way to run this on its own here. I can search whenever you ask — just say
'check Homing'."*

Isolation rung 0 is **not** this case. A scheduler that exists still gets used at rung 0, once
the person has said yes — see §8.

Never substitute Claude Code's `/loop` for a scheduler: it is session-scoped, dies with the
conversation, and a recurring task auto-expires seven days after creation. Claude Code Desktop
scheduled tasks (`~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/<name>/SKILL.md`) are durable but fire only while
the app is open and the machine awake, and a missed 9am can be caught up at 11pm — pick a
Desktop task **or** a LaunchAgent, never both.

---

## 6. Locking

The portable lock is an atomic `mkdir` **directory** containing a PID file, with a staleness
check. `mkdir` is atomic on every POSIX filesystem including NFS.

**macOS ships neither `flock` nor `timeout`.** Do not emit `flock` in a cross-platform runner.
And `trap ... EXIT` is not SIGKILL-safe — a stale lock left by a killed run has already silently
disabled a real Homing job for a full day, exiting 0 every morning with nothing in the log.

```sh
LOCK="$STATE/run.lock"
if ! mkdir "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null; then
  stale=0
  if [ -f "$LOCK/pid" ] && ! kill -0 "$(cat "$LOCK/pid" 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null; then stale=1; fi
  # belt and braces: a lock dir older than 2x the run bound is stale regardless of pid reuse
  if [ -n "$(find "$LOCK" -maxdepth 0 -mmin +40 2>/dev/null)" ]; then stale=1; fi
  if [ "$stale" -eq 1 ]; then rm -rf "$LOCK"; mkdir "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null || { echo "locked"; exit 0; }
  else echo "already running; exiting cleanly"; exit 0; fi
fi
echo $$ > "$LOCK/pid"
trap 'rm -rf "$LOCK"' EXIT INT TERM
```

Exit **0** when another copy holds the lock — "already running" is not a failure and must not
light up a health check.

Portable timeout, since macOS has no `timeout`:

```sh
run_bounded() {  # run_bounded <seconds> <cmd...>; exit 142 on timeout
  secs="$1"; shift
  if command -v timeout  >/dev/null 2>&1; then timeout  -k 30 "$secs" "$@"; return $?; fi
  if command -v gtimeout >/dev/null 2>&1; then gtimeout -k 30 "$secs" "$@"; return $?; fi
  perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' "$secs" "$@"
}
```

Three independent layers, all of them: the scheduler's own single-instance behaviour, this
lock, and Homing's five-minute run lease (the only one that prevents *cross-machine* overlap).

---

## 7. Logging

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Logs/Homing/run-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.log` (also visible in Console.app) |
| Linux | journald via `SyslogIdentifier=homing-check`; rotation is already solved |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Homing\logs\` plus `Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational` |
| Container | stdout → the orchestrator's log driver |

launchd's `StandardOutPath` never rotates; the runner must. Directory 0700, files 0600, set by
`umask 077` before the first redirect — not by `chmod` after.

```sh
umask 077
LOG="$LOGDIR/run-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log"
find "$LOGDIR" -type f -name 'run-*.log' -mtime +14 -delete
```

Redaction filter on everything going to disk — a backstop, not the primary control:

```sh
redact() { sed -E \
  -e 's/(Bearer|Authorization:)[[:space:]]*[A-Za-z0-9._~+/=-]{8,}/\1 <redacted>/g' \
  -e 's/(st_live_|sk-ant-|ghp_|github_pat_)[A-Za-z0-9._-]{8,}/\1<redacted>/g' \
  -e 's/(claim_token"?[[:space:]]*[:=][[:space:]]*"?)[^",[:space:]]+/\1<redacted>/g'; }
run_bounded 1200 "$BIN/phase.sh" 2>&1 | redact >>"$LOG"
```

Never `set -x` in a script that touches the key. Never `curl -v` — it prints the
`Authorization:` header to stderr, which lands in the launchd log, which the agent then reads.
Never log raw listing HTML: untrusted, large, and its ANSI escapes corrupt any terminal that
later `cat`s the log. Log structured fields — source, id, url, decision.

## 8. Isolation rungs

Climb to the highest rung the probe finds, and record which one in `config.json`.

| Rung | What it is | Where you get it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Narrow tool surface: two verbs (`homing.py`, `sources.py`), no raw shell, no `curl`/`wget`, no subagent spawn, no reads of `bin/**` | every runtime with a permission config |
| 2 | Restricted working directory | Claude Code `--add-dir` scope; Codex `--sandbox workspace-write --add-dir`; Gemini `--sandbox` |
| 3 | **Egress allowlist enforced outside the model** | Claude Code `sandbox.enabled` + `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false` + `network.allowedDomains`; a container behind an egress proxy |
| 5 | Container | any cloud harness |
| 6 | Managed harness with network config | Claude Code cloud Routine with Custom network access |

Rung ≥3 → full unattended capability. Rung 1–2 only → keep the wrapper gates, halve the write
budget, prefer pull sources (feeds, sitemaps, official APIs) over page fetching.

### Rung 0 — one policy, stated once

An ordinary laptop has no sandbox, no egress allowlist and no container, so it reports rung 0.
That is the machine this product is built for, so **rung 0 does schedule** — but only on a
decision the person made, never one the installing agent made for them.

`install.py` refuses a rung-0 plan that schedules anything unless the plan carries
`"unattended_rung0_opt_in": true`, and the refusal names the sentence to say to the person:
a background search will run on this computer with nothing on the computer limiting what it
can reach; it cannot delete or restore anything; the part that reads websites holds no account
key; and it can be stopped from Homing at any time. Say it, get an answer, then set the flag —
or set `scheduler.kind` to `none` and install the on-demand runner instead. Do not set the flag
on the person's behalf.

What holds the run at rung 0 is not the OS, and the install report says so in those words:

* the paired token carries no `leads:destroy` scope, and the client has no destructive verb;
* `sources.py` holds no credential at all, so an untrusted page can never reach one;
* the model is started with a fixed argument list and gets `JUDGE.md` plus two files — no
  shell, no network of its own, no credential, no other file on the machine;
* the runner bounds every run from outside the model: wall clock, memory, largest file, kit
  calls per run, writes per run, zero deletes;
* the install writes only into `<config>`, `<state>` and `<logs>`; `bin/` is 0500, the plan and
  source list are 0400, and the pairing helper's `<config>/private/` is 0700 and named in no
  config, state or skill file;
* pause is one command locally and one click in Homing, which works when the machine is off;
  revocation is in Homing only, and holds even when the machine is out of the person's hands.

The write budget is still halved below rung 3, and feeds are still preferred over page
fetching. Rung 0 changes who decides, not what the run is allowed to do.

**The honest note about blanket-approval flags.** Some schedulers can only invoke an agent by
turning every approval off. Never emit `--dangerously-skip-permissions`,
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `--yolo`,
`-y`, or `--force` into a scheduled job. Safe forms: `claude -p --permission-mode dontAsk`;
`codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --approve-for-me`; `gemini --approval-mode default
--policy <file> --sandbox`. **If the only way to make a runtime unattended is a flag whose name
contains "dangerous", "yolo", "bypass", or "skip-permissions", do not install a schedule for
that runtime.**

Two related facts. A Claude Code cloud Routine has no permission-mode picker and no approval
prompts, and can use every tool from an included connector — writes included — without asking;
strip every connector it does not need. And Claude Code disables trust verification under `-p`,
which every scheduled run is, so the first-run trust dialog is not a control that exists here.
Where the chosen rung still lets the runner read other files on the machine, tell the user
exactly that, in one sentence.

## 9. Uninstall and pause

Uninstall is driven by `<state>/install-manifest.json` and must be idempotent. Order matters:

1. Disable the schedule, so nothing fires mid-teardown.
2. Kill any in-flight run and `rm -rf` the lock directory.
3. **If this worker currently holds a claimed Homing run, complete it with
   `status: failed` and the summary `worker uninstalled`.** Otherwise the project stays locked
   for up to five minutes and the next worker sees a confusing `409`.
4. Delete the scheduler artifact (plist / unit files / task / routine).
5. Delete state; offer to keep logs.
6. Delete the secret-store item.
7. Hand the user the URL to disconnect the key in Homing — the agent cannot revoke its own
   token — and print exactly what was removed.

Pause has two levels; name the second one to the user. Locally: `bootout` /
`systemctl --user disable --now` / `Disable-ScheduledTask`. Server-side: Homing's own pause,
which the runner honours by exiting immediately. Server-side pause is the one that still works
when the user is not in front of the machine, so it is the one to name in the report.

Write `<state>/UNINSTALL.md` with the literal commands for the environment you actually chose —
not a menu of all five.

## 10. Multi-worker lanes

Default is **one worker**. A second exists only when the probe found two runtimes with durable
schedulers *and* the user chose it.

A **lane** is a stable slug for one legitimate access path to one source — `daft:sitemap`,
`listingsproject:rss`, `nyc-opendata:socrata`, `streeteasy:manual`, `email:alerts:zillow`.

**Lanes are assigned statically at install, to the narrowest capable worker.** Residential-only
and inbox lanes (`residential_required`) go to the **local** worker — the user's own machine,
own IP, own inbox. Lanes needing a person go to neither and surface as a task. Everything else
goes to the cloud worker if one exists, else local. The result is baked into each worker's
`sources.json` as a literal lane list, so two workers never contend: neither knows how to run
the other's lanes. No leader election, no distributed lock, no clock agreement.

Stagger the schedules. Never `:00`, never `:30` (Claude Code jitters recurring fires up to 30
minutes; GitHub Actions drops peak-of-hour load). Two workers never share a minute — e.g. cloud
at `:07` on even hours, local at `:37` on odd hours.

Only the **write** phase holds Homing's run lease, and it targets under 60 seconds. Read and
search hold nothing.

**`409 run_already_claimed` means park the batch and back off — never "skip this project".**
Skipping throws away search work already paid for in tokens and network. Write the batch to
`<state>/parked/<project>/<lane>-<sha256>.json` (0600) with its intended idempotency key, move
to the next project immediately, and retry with jittered backoff 5 / 15 / 45 / 120 s (±25%,
≤4 min). Still claimed → exit 0 as "deferred", not a failure. Every run drains `parked/` before
the search phase. A batch older than about six days is replayed with a **fresh** idempotency key
and a byte-identical payload; never bump `observed_at` on drain. A peer holding a live lease is
normal and must never appear in user-facing output.

Handoff is by observation only. A cloud worker reports what it could not reach in
`continuation.needs_local`; the local worker reads recent run events, takes the newest run whose
`agent_label` starts with `homing/cloud-`, and unions that list into its own lane set for that
cycle — a missed cycle self-heals on the next cloud run. Local silent >72 h → the cloud worker
appends one project comment, at most once per 7 days. Cloud silent >24 h → the local worker
takes every lane it can legitimately serve, says so in its summary, and reverts automatically.

A worker that finds nothing still completes a run. "Ran, found nothing" and "didn't run" must
stay distinguishable, and the run record is the only place that distinction lives.
